# OO Design Patterns

A repo with examples of Object Oriented Design Patterns.

I am studying the topic on the book: [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/). This repo contains examples largely coming from that book - I re-interpret some of the patterns to test my knowledge, authors have no responsibilities if I put in errors/imperfections.

I may make some YouTube videos, over the course of my studies of the topic. My channel is called [Tutor Island](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKkzN06obaHk8mt3iBTp6qw?sub_confirmation=1), if you want to follow along...and discover other videos on related topics.
